# Small repo for learning to use the Hypothesis package

[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a package for property based testing in python.

I (and everyone else) should definitely be using this so i'm going to use this repo to got to grips with how it works.

## Get started

Create the conda environment:
```{bash}
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

Running tests:
```{bash}
python -m pytest
```
